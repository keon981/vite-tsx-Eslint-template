## Getting Started

1. Getting started is a simple as cloning the repository
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:keon981/vite-tsx-app.git

   ```
2. Changing into the new directory
   ```
   cd vite-tsx-app
   ```
3. Installing dependencies
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Removing the .git folder (and any additional files, folders or dependencies you may not need)
   ```
   rm -rf .git
   ```

Congrats! You're ready to starting working on that new project!

> If you'd rather run the commands above in one go, check out the command below：
>
> ```
> git clone git@github.com:keon981/vite-tsx-app.git &&\
> cd vite-tsx-app &&\
> pnpm install &&\
> rm -rf .git
> ```

## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library and Vitest while End-to-End (E2E) Testing is conducted by Playwright.

If you'd like to run all tests, Unit and E2E alike, execute the following command:

```
pnpm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute vitest:

```
pnpm run test:unit
```

If instead you are interested in coverage reporting, run:

```
pnpm run coverage
```
